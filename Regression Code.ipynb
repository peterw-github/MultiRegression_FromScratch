    "### 1. Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the independent variables created at the start, should be scaled appropriately (there's quite a few different ways to do so). If they aren't, then the variables that are on the largest scales, such as millions or above, are what the \n",
    "MLA trains/adapts to the most (so the weights for these larger scale variables, will become highly accurate), whereas the variables on the smallest scales, such as singles, or tenths, etc, are basically ignored/given the least priority, because they have a much smaller impact on the cost (so the weights for these smaller scale variables, will end up pretty inaccurate).\n",
    "\n",
    "- (This is actually why the final weights the MLA came up with, are different to some of the variables coefficients, because most likely, those variables are the smallest scale ones, that don't matter anywhere near as much)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if the independent variables were scaled, then the runtime of the training process, would be \n",
    "significantly improved/optimized (assuming the independent variables are on wildly different scales to begin with). \n",
    "This is because, in simple/intuitive terms, if the variables are on wildly different scales relative to each other, \n",
    "then the graph of the cost function essentially becomes warped (along certain axes), meaning the direction of steepest \n",
    "descent at most points, isn't actually pointing directly at the local minimum, but is instead off by a certain angle. \n",
    "The bigger the difference in scales between the independent the variables, the more \"off\" the direction of steepest descent\n",
    "will be (capping out at almost 90 degrees). Further explanation on this is in the PDF.\n",

    "### 2. Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, vectorization should be utilised as much as possible, instead of what was used, whiiteration and the use of loops. This \n",
    "would significantly speed up runtime, as calculations become array based, and currently the training part of this project\n",
    "has a runtime of in the scale of tens of seconds. (Vectorization wasn't done for this project,\n",
    "as it requires an understanding of linear algebra, which would make the explanations even longer)"
